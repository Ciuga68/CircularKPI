# CircularKPI
Create simple Qlik Sense KPIs with this extension. It supports percentage (%) KPIs up to 300%. Great for showing target achievements with optional animation of values.

The extension is using the open source code from BrightPoint Consulting (slightly modified) from here:
http://www.brightpointinc.com/download/radial-progress-source-code/

I've added a number of themes to change the colors used and a property for setting the animation

EDIT 20160402: CircularKPI now supports dropping a dimension on the object to create an array of KPI items. Thanks to Alexander Karlsson for the pull request.

EDIT #2 20160402: Added opacity settings while making selections in dimension driven KPI array to highlight selected vs non-selected values. Plus optional labels for single KPIs without dimension.
