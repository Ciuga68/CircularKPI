# CircularKPI
Create simple Qlik Sense KPIs with this extension. It supports percentage (%) KPIs up to 300%. Great for showing target achievements with optional animation of values.

The extension is using the open source code from BrightPoint Consulting (slightly modified) from here:
http://www.brightpointinc.com/download/radial-progress-source-code/

I've added a number of themes to change the colors used and a property for setting the animation
